# My rendition of Conway's Game of Life

## For each generation (step):

- Survival

A live cell with 2 or 3 live neighbors stays alive.

Otherwise, it dies (from underpopulation or overpopulation).

- Birth

A dead cell with exactly 3 live neighbors becomes alive (as if by reproduction).

- All other cases

The cell is dead in the next generation.
